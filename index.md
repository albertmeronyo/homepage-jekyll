![alt text](img/amp.jpg) I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Knowledge Representation & Reasoning Group of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I investigate the integration of and access to diverse types of knowledge, with a special interest in Digital Humanities data and workflows. I am interested in knowledge graphs, Linked Data, Web query languages, and APIs.
